# mysql-plus-api

Express api using MySQL transactions and different dead simple api calls

## Getting Started
You can find [DOCS](#DOCS) at the end of the page

Make sure that you are putting your database credentials in `db/index.js` file

```js
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: '<database host>',
  user: '<database username>',
  password: '<database password>',
  database: '<database name>'
})

```

A table named `todolist` must be created in your database with `owner` and `task` columns to be compatible with the transactions.

You can copy and run the following code to create a table

```mysql
--This creates the table for your need

CREATE TABLE todolist(
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  owner VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  task TEXT NOT NULL
);

```

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
